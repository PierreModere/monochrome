# 3D MODELS

By placing your model here (.glb, .gltf or .fbx), it will be automatically imported in your project.
The name of your file will be used to name the variable that will contains your model.

Example:
Take a look at `js/World/Suzanne.js`:
With a file `suzanne.glb`, you can acces your model with `this.models.src.suzanne`
